## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system uses a **multi-agent architecture** with LangGraph:

```
User Query → Router Agent → Specialized Agents → Response Synthesis
                  ↓
    ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
    ↓             ↓             ↓
Discovery    Verification   Planning
 Agent         Agent         Agent
    ↓             ↓             ↓
         Response Aggregator
                  ↓
           Final Output
```
